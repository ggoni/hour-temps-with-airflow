# Comparing temperatures between two places ("Comunas")


:##Â Context

We are using Airflow to run an API query every hour (I know is overkill ðŸ˜Š)

Here are the steps to take to get airflow 2.0 running with docker on your machine. 
1. Clone this repo

1. Install docker desktop application if you don't have docker running on your machine
- [Download Docker Desktop Application for Mac OS](https://hub.docker.com/editions/community/docker-ce-desktop-mac)
- [Download Docker Desktop Application for Windows](https://hub.docker.com/editions/community/docker-ce-desktop-windows)

## Obtain API Key

- Go to [this url](http://api.weatherapi.com/) and get yours
- Save the API Key in an .env file (We are using dotenv): Check *dag_with_python_weather.py* for details 

## Docker instructions

1. Launch airflow by docker-compose
    ```bash
    docker-compose up -d
    ```

2. Check the running containers
    ```bash
    docker ps
    ```

3. Go to `localhost:8080`

4. Check that the dag named *dag_with_python_weather* is running

## Pending work

- [ ] Fix relative paths
- [ ] Improve plots
- [ ] Persist in the database
